          If you’re anything like us here at Lost In Place, your much needed alone
          time (or family/roomate/coworker pile-on) has turned to much needed
          social time. But hanging out indoors and widening our circles of
          exposure is irresponsible at best. But with warmer weather, comes a
          lovely solution: the picnic. So we have outlined everything you need to
          meet up, be safe, and mangia.

          Connection is one of the most vital aspects of human life. Not just
          entertainment, we need to form emotional attachments to survive.

          When you’re commuting to a 9-to-5, you long for the weekends, the beach
          and the get-things-done, life-organizing staycation. Our current
          environment has turned life on its head, and now more than ever we dream
          of being anywhere but at home. Until a quick trip to a new locale is an
          option, we’ve got everything you need to get away at home.

          My mother spoke Spanish with us at home from birth, through our
          disdainful teenage years, and on every phone call until the day she
          passed. When I was a youngster without the perspective that comes with
          experience, I asked her why she was so dedicated to us being bilingual.
          The simple answer, “If you and your sister do not know Spanish, you
          cannot teach it to your children.”

          Our Look Up Column is normally dedicated to the different ways travel
          gets you out of your digital dungeon, and into a new way of experiencing
          life. Since our writers and photographers are at home for the
          foreseeable future, Look Up will now dedicate space to finding that same
          feeling in the sky. Each week a writer and a photographer will team up
          to show and tell how the sky has changed in their city, and how the act
          of slowing down and giving attention to something so simple has carried
          over into life.

          Lauren Paul and her husband spent all of last week cancelling their
          honeymoon. “We were devastated until we realized how dangerous not
          cancelling would have been for all of the hospitality workers we would
          have depended on.” Lauren reported. Not one to dwell on life’s curve
          balls, Lauren and Jose decided to bring a little Provence into their
          home. “We had already done so much research on the food, the farming
          culture, the way people care for the land in Provence. We thought, why
          not spend a day pretending we’re there.”
