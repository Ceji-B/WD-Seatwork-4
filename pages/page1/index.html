      <h1>Vigan City</h1>
      <p>
        A UNESCO World Heritage site located in the Ilocos Sur province of the Philippines. Renowned for its well-preserved Spanish colonial and Asian architecture, it features cobblestone streets, historic buildings, and horse-drawn carriages known as kalesa. Vigan offers a unique glimpse into the Philippines' colonial past with attractions such as Calle Crisologo, Bantay Bell Tower, and Baluarte. The city's blend of cultures, rich history, and picturesque settings make it a popular destination for both local and international tourists.

    <div id="section2" class="section"><h2>Characteristics</h2>
      <h3>Size</h3>
      <p>The domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European wildcat.[48] It averages about 46 cm (18 in) in head-to-body length and 23–25 cm (9.1–9.8 in) in height, with about 30 cm (12 in) long tails. Males are larger than females.[49] Adult domestic cats typically weigh 4–5 kg (8.8–11.0 lb).</p>

    <div id="section3" class="section"><h2>Communication</h2>
      <p>Domestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, including purring, trilling, hissing, growling/snarling, grunting, and several different forms of meowing.[105] Their body language, including position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of mood. The tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms; a raised tail indicates a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicate hostility. Tail-raising also indicates the cat's position in the group's social hierarchy, with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate ones.[106] Feral cats are generally silent.[107]: 208  Nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by social grooming, which is solicited by one of the cats raising and tilting its head.</p>

    <div id="section4" class="section"><h2>Whiskers</h2><p>To aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable whiskers (vibrissae) over their body, especially their faces. These provide information on the width of gaps and on the location of objects in the dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents; they also trigger protective blink reflexes to protect the eyes from damage</p></div>
