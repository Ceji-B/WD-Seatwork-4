        A UNESCO World Heritage site located in the Ilocos Sur province of the Philippines. Renowned for its well-preserved Spanish colonial and Asian architecture, it features cobblestone streets, historic buildings, and horse-drawn carriages known as kalesa. Vigan offers a unique glimpse into the Philippines' colonial past with attractions such as Calle Crisologo, Bantay Bell Tower, and Baluarte. The city's blend of cultures, rich history, and picturesque settings make it a popular destination for both local and international tourists.
